# Girls Who Code Virtual SIP Projects
## GWC SIP: What is it?
The Summer Immersion Program is a two-week virtual program that teaches girls and non-binary students computer science and languages needed for web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). During the Summer Immersion Program, I connected with industry professionals from The Walt Disney Company, met other girls and non-binary individuals interested in technology and computer science, and learned how to create interactive, stylish websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Personal Website
### 🤔 What is it?
My Personal Website for the 2021 Girls Who Code Virtual Summer Immersion Program. It was the first project I worked on during the Summer Immersion Program, and I created it using `HTML` and `CSS` over the course of two days. This website's purpose is to allow visitors to get to know me! I included images, facts about myself, and my favorite songs in this website, allowing users to learn more about and connect with me. <br>
