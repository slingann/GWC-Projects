# Girls Who Code Virtual SIP Projects
## Personal Website
### ðŸ¤” What is it?
My Personal Website for the 2021 Girls Who Code Virtual Summer Immersion Program. It was the first project I worked on during the Summer Immersion Program, and I created it using HTML and CSS over the course of two days. This website's purpose is to allow visitors to get to know me! I included images, facts about myself, and my favorite songs in this website, allowing users to learn more about and connect with me.

## Personality Quiz
### ðŸ¤” What is it?
My Personality Quiz for the 2021 Girls Who Code Virtual Summer Immersion Program. I worked on this project for two days and used what I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the program to create this quiz. This quiz is meant to entertain users/quiz takers. Quiz takers can find out which of six Disney Fairies characters they are by answering a series of questions!
