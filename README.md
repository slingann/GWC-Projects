# Girls Who Code Virtual SIP Projects

## Personal Website
### 🤔 What is it?
My Personal Website for the 2021 Girls Who Code Virtual Summer Immersion Program. It was the first project I worked on during the Summer Immersion Program, and I created it using HTML and CSS over the course of two days. This website's purpose is to allow visitors to get to know me! I included images, facts about myself, and my favorite songs in this website, allowing users to learn more about and connect with me. <br>
